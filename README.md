# Brazilian-fires

How many fires and how many hectares of forest area are newly planted in Brazil each year?

The visualisation answers this question by representing fires for each state of Brazil with colour, where lower transparency denotes higher number of fires in that state.
Planted forests areas are ilustrated with green dots, where bigger dots mean bigger area.

Legends on the right quickly explain the scope of data, whereas hovering the mouse above a specific state brings out an exact number of fires and planted forests area in that state.

Visualisation timelines enable showing the data for desired month and year. Player buttons allow playing visualisation over time.

Data are from period 2006 to 2016, acquired from Brazilian open data portal: http://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif
Not all states have planted forest area data, so only those who do, are visualised.
